## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Java** (JDK 11 or later)
- **Spring Boot**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Node.js** and **npm** (for running the frontend)
- **React.js**

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory.
2. Configure your `application.properties` file with your PostgreSQL database credentials:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database_name
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

3. Build and run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Database Setup
1. Create a PostgreSQL database for the project.
